# Tableau_Project
Here we discuss the HAR (Human Activity Recognition) model, which includes many steps.

By following the steps outlined in this project, I have gained knowledge on:

1.Understanding the importance of HAR in different applications and its potential impact on various domains. 

2.Selecting and preprocessing a suitable HAR dataset for analysis. 

3.Exploring different machine learning algorithms and techniques for feature extraction and selection. 

4.Training and evaluating a HAR model to achieve accurate activity recognition. 

5.Importing the preprocessed HAR dataset into Tableau and preparing it for visualization. 

6.Creating interactive and visually appealing visualizations using Tableau's intuitive interface. 

7.Adding interactivity and filters to enable dynamic exploration of the HAR data. 

8.Designing a comprehensive dashboard in Tableau to present actionable insights.
